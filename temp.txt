Building a wall along the southern border is necessary to protect our country from illegal immigration, drug smuggling, and other crime. The fact is, we have an open border that allows criminals and other bad actors to enter the United States without any consequences. We need to put a stop to this and make sure that our border is secure. A wall is an effective way to do that. It would help us to control who comes into our country and strengthen our national security. Without a strong border, we cannot have a strong country.
